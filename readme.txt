Adds enhanced features for users of “Offers for WooCommerce” by AngellEye. (Ask us about extending other offers plugins.)

== Description ==

**General Features**

* Modify the “Add to Cart” button text if the product permits making an offer (eg. “Make it yours now:  Add to Cart”).
* Ability to hide the “Add to Cart” button if the intent is to only offer products with a suggested price.
* Ability to set the Qty field to 1 and hide it for products where offers must be made per item or the item is unique.
* Hide the Make Offer tab until the “Make Offer” button is clicked.
* Add the ability to immediately notify the customer when attempting to submit an offer if the offer will be automatically rejected so that they can change the offer and resubmit it.
* Add an Admin note above the offer fields when creating a new offer in the Admin.
* Add an Admin note above the offer fields when managing an offer in the Admin.
* Add the ability for the administrator to edit the heading and notes at the top of the Offer form on the storefront.
* Add the ability to assign offers to new products when they are added to the store.

**Features associated with Booster Multicurrency**

* Support Booster Multicurrency so that all offers and counteroffers, as well as all email messages, use the currency at the time the offer was made.
* The customer can change the currency used when making a counteroffer, but the store owner must honor the customer’s currency choice.
* When managing an order in the Admin, the counteroffer is always in the currency selected by the customer when making the offer or last counteroffer.
* Products added to the cart from an offer will always show the offer price in whatever is the current currency requested on the storefront.
* When the customer views his outstanding offers on the storefront, they show in the currency currently selected for the storefront.
* When showing an offer in a different currency from the one it was made in, the offer price shows as the original offer price modified by the ratio of the product price in the two currencies.
* Tokens provided so that the chosen currency and product price can be displayed in the storefront heading information when making an offer.
* Tokens provided so that the note above the offer information when adding or editing an offer in the Admin can contain the product price (only for editing an offer) and currency of the offer.
